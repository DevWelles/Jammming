# App built with Spotify API

## Created with
- Javascript
- React
- HTML, CSS
- [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) API 

## Introduction
This is still a work in progress. Below are listed features that are currently implemented and a list of new features that I am currently working on.
The main functionality of this app is to allow users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.
In addition users will be ablee to select and update their existing playlists.


## Features that are already implemented

- Spotify Login — the first time a user searches for a song, album, or artist, Spotify will ask them to log in or set up a new account.

- Search by Song, Album, or Artist — a user can type the name of a song, artist, or album into the search bar. The app will request song data about the user's input from the Spotify library (find Spotify endpoints here).

- Populate Results List — Jammming displays the list of returned tracks from the user's query.

- Add Song to a Custom Playlist — users can add a track to their playlist by selecting a + sign on the right side of the track's display container.

- Remove Song from Custom Playlist — users can remove a track from their playlist by selecting a - sign on the right side of the track's display container.

- Change Playlist Title — users can change the title of their custom playlist.

- Save Playlist to Account — users can save their custom playlist by clicking a button called SAVE TO SPOTIFY.

## Fetures that I am working on

- Only display songs not currently present in the playlist in the search results
